## Overview

Radius 15 is an application designed to promote sustainable living by visualizing essential services within a 15-minute walking radius. By encouraging users to rely less on cars and embrace walking or cycling, we aim to foster healthier, greener communities.

## Features

1. **Customizable Map View**: Users can customize the map view to display specific categories of necessities and services, such as grocery stores, parks, cafes, schools, and public transportation stops.
2. **Search Functionality**: The map includes a search feature that enables users to quickly find specific locations or types of establishments within a 15-minute radius.
3. **Interactive Markers**: Interactive markers on the map provide additional information about each location, including hours of operation, reviews, contact details, and directions.
4. **Multi-Stop Route Optimization**: Optimize routes for efficiency, saving time and minimizing carbon footprint.

## How We Built It

- **Frontend**: Developed using React for a dynamic and responsive user interface.
- **Backend**: Utilized Google Maps API and Google Places API for location data and mapping functionalities.
- **Task Division**: Split tasks into frontend development and API integration, working in parallel to fetch and render data correctly.
